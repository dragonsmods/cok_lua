Train your troops, build your traps to let others know how mighty you are!\nMeanwhile, seeing as you lost your shield, the Traveling Merchant has agreed to give you a special price. He awaits near the city walls. Refresh the goods and find the Premium ones!
105794=My Lord,\nNow you can build the Hall of War, which allows you to assemble your allies and crush anyone who stands in your way!\nAttack is the best form of defense. Since we have already trained enough troops, let's attack our enemies! Don't forget to scout before any battle. A wise Lord never acts rashly.
105795=My Lord,\nYour selflessness removed your people from their suffering. Now it's time to give them faith. Build the Wishing Well to worship the gods, and the gods will grant us an abundance of materials.\nYou may receive many resources in the Wishing Well, but I suggest you wish for Steel, which not only is a necessary resource for forging, but also can't be plundered by other Lords.
105796=My Lord,\nWe have finally established the Trade Routes between you and your allies. As long as you have a Market, you will be able to trade resources with your allies.\nRegarding the Alliance, it's time to carry out your duties. You may help the construction of Alliance Buildings and donate your resources to improve Alliance Science. This will award you Alliance Honor that you can use to buy items in the Alliance Store.
105797=My Lord,\nIt's an inspiring day! Technical advisers from the Chamber of Commerce are teaching our workmen Smelting Technology. We should build Iron Mines to collect Iron now. The woods outside your city seems to be a good place for them.\nNow we are powerful enough to participate in events like "The Dark Knight" and the "Dragon Campaign" in the Event Center. Please pay attention to the announcements in the Event Center.

The Prime Minister rearranged the Brotherhood before things went south, and formed the Supreme Legion and the Black Bone Parliament. The King also commissioned the construction of the Discipline Hall for the Supreme Legion in the Torrent Valley as a prize.\n\nEvery soldier from the Supreme Legion wears armor forged by Fine Iron which was hard to smith and retains high value.

As the most respected and most fearsome power on this land, the title “Paladin” is the final goal of all soldiers.\n\nDifferent from the nobles of the Knights College; Paladins are determined to be the most powerful and they stick to their path of fierce beliefs of the knights Virtue and combat training.\n\nA Knight without exploits will not win respect and promotions, nor could they afford the armor or the horse.

You can find every single characteristic of an ultimate predator within them. It’s impossible to tame a mature griffin, which is now written in the <Adventurer Guild 101>. But only the Bocanpuna Family has been smart enough to turn their eyes to the cubs. They climb on the cliff and steal the 3-month-old griffin cubs and give them to young people who want to become Griffin Knights.\n\nBecoming a Griffin Knight is not an easy task. Flight training during domestication is challenging and deadly. The young man has to not only overcome the wind pressure during the flight, but also build a strong bond with the beast to finally get the title: Griffin Knight, the fastest, deadliest, most efficient air force of the Lionheart Empire!"

A mid-range unit, they will throw ignited oil bombs at heavy-armored enemies as soon as they enter the Del Fire’s range. The fragile oil bombs contain flammable oil; the hot oil will leak into the enemy’s armor and howls of anguish will spread across the battlefield. The bombs also contain spiky nails, which may blind enemies by impaling their eyes.\n\nThe Del Fire usually work in groups. A 2-man, well-cooperating Del Fire team is a nightmare to everyone who is heavily fortified.\n\nEven the mighty Black Bone Legion fell in front of them at the Achilles Basin...."

One day some would-be adventurers put together a team, and set off into the darkness! However, only one of them came back, his body covered in burns.\n\nThe young man had gone insane, he kept shouting the same words. “Gronde! Gronde! Gronde!” However, no one knew what he was taking about... Days later he was found dead, next to a strange drawing on the wall. The drawing was an unknown animal head surrounded by fire; it was a truly terrifying image.\n\nThe king later got wind of the story and used it as an opportunity to make a horrible new weapon.

In recent decades, with the development of Taiwan's economy, many large urban department stores arranged snacks on the streets in front of their buildings.\nDue to their unique food culture, Taiwanese snacks are often purchased in some rather unique night markets. At the beginning, many night markets popped up in crowded locations, so most of them are beside temples or busy road intersections. As Taiwan continued to develop, the night markets became common sight and now play an important part in Taiwanese culture.\nTaiwan’s fish balls are one of the most appreciated snacks.

It made its first appearance in 1959 and has been adapted into movies, games and even a theme park! The comics have been translated into over 110 languages and have sold over 350 million copies worldwide. \nThe story is centered around a small Gaulish village, on the coast of modern day Brittany, a province in Gaul (now France). By 50 BC, Julius Caesar has conquered all of Gaul except for this small enclave, vexing him to no end. Surrounded on all sides by the sea and 4 unlucky Roman garrisons, the villagers are able to resist repeated attempts by the Romans to invade them due to a magic potion brewed by the village druid, Getafix. Asterix, the eponymous hero, is a rather short but fearless warrior known for his cunning and down-to -earth attitude. He is often entrusted with missions on behalf of the villagers and village chief, Vitalstatistix. He goes on the quests armed with the potion that bestows superhuman strength and is almost always accompanied by his closest friend, Obelix. Obelix is a simple-minded menhir sculptor well known for being “big boned” but prefers to refer to himself as well covered or whose chest has “slipped a bit”. Obelix fell into the magic potion during his childhood so he is no longer allowed to drink it, much to his dismay. In one of the stories, the two of them adopt a small dog called Dogmatix.  This smart, nature-loving creature has a short temper and absolutely no sense of direction when it comes to sniffing out a trail. He is usually seen tagging along on the pair's adventures, adding to the mischief and helping them in some situations.\nMy Lord, help the trio collect magic potion to keep their village safe.

On the 1st April, people usually play tricks on each other for fun, and they will tell the truth finally to declare that the one who was cheated is a "fool". It is said that in 1965, the king of France Charles IX decided to change New Year's Day from 1st April to 1st January. However, some people who stick to the old ways didn't agree with that, and they still celebrate new year on 1st April. So the innovators teased them a lot on this day, they would send them fake presents and invite them to fake parties. From then on, people always tease other people on April 1st.\n\nDuring April Fool’s Day, there will be Jesters on the kingdom map. You can go to the Jesters to obtain Jester Hats randomly, and then you can combine different hats to synthesize a Surprise Chest. But you won't know what's in the hat from its appearance.\nIf you are lucky, you will get the Guardian Castle Skin from the Jester.

168569=My Lord, no need to worry. The Kingdom will provide you great rewards for you to research Science fast.

168572=My Lord, we need Food! Wood for constructions is also running out!

168574=While Grey Cregane betrayed you, Lords were attacked by the Black Bones, they're in dire need of allies to defend themselves against the Black Bones!

168576=My Lord, you can choose the Alliance you like to join, from the Alliance interface.
168577=Donate items in the Alliance interface and talk to your Allies,  you will make more friends here!
168578=Okay, let's do it!
168579=Found the enemy camp, we'll investigate carefully

168581=Oh, really? How many? Are they heavily guarded?
168582=Judging by the footsteps, the enemy is a small unit, not too many of them.
168583="Very well, send a unit to scout, and then call for a rally; lets destroy them all!"
168584=Your Troops charged into the defenseless camp, only to find another fierce army there. Your troops got into a bitter fight. While you noticed a chained giant beast deep inside the cave...
168585=Scout! Scout! I'll take your head down! How did you do your work? This amount is not “not much” at all!
168586=My Lord, they deceived us! Another army was hiding out in the cave!
168587=We can't breakthrough, and sealed the cave!
168588="You found a massive beast chained up in the cave. Moving closer you realized it was a giant Black Dragon, it was guarding a big egg with a scarred shell. Without thought you ordered your men to eliminate all the Black Bone Troops guarding the Black Dragon, and to release the beast. Suddenly with a deafening roar the Dragon broke free of its chains. The menacing beast rose up giving a hateful gaze towards the Black Bones, with a slow long inhale... With no warning She sprayed out the most intense fire you could imagine, fire that could melt rock! The painful howls of men could be heard for miles; when the fire settled only ashes remained."
168589=This is an ancient Black Dragon, it wiped out the Black Bones with just one breath
168590=But she fell, after spraying out her last breath of hate for Black Bones, the light within her eyes has gone.
168591=Hey! Here's a Dragon Egg, it’s the spawn of that poor Black Dragon, we should be the ones to take care of it!
168592=This...is too dangerous! Besides, I don't know how to hatch a Dragon!
168593=After the battle in the cave, Novia brought the Dragon Egg back to your Castle, a little black dragon hatched soon after. its great appetite troubled the Quartermaster a lot. While Princess Novia cannot stop loving the Dragon.
168594=Look how fast it's grown! The claws and the sharp teeth, oh, the fire! it's so cute, I'm sure it will be of great help in the future!
168595=Your Highness, it seems you have a little misunderstanding on cute. Dragons are ancient creatures that bare great power from the day they are born.
168596=We are caring for the the little Dragon, during which you should build a connection between you and the Dragon, only this way the Dragon can be more powerful!
168597=During the days Novia played with little Black Dragon, a giant army arrived and pledge allegiance to you! You need more room and supplies to sustain the army. Therefore you should speedup the building upgrades!
168598=With the heedful care of the Lord and Novia, the Black Dragon can now join the march. Princess Novia suggested you let Black Dragon join the march and gain more battle experience.
168599=The Black Dragon can now march with troops, it's time to show her power to the enemies!
